The `Modal` component displays its content in an overlay. The modal can be closed with a close button, if the user clicks outside of the modal content, or if the escape button is pressed. The modal can also be closed from outside.

## Basic usage

This example shows how to use the modal component

**Example 1** - simple modal:

```html
<stream-modal [(isOpen)]="isModalOpen">
  <!-- Modal content here -->
</stream-modal>
```

## Customization

You can provide your own modal component by the [`CustomTemplatesService`](../services/CustomTemplatesService.mdx)

[//]: # "Start of generated content"
[//]: # "End of generated content"
